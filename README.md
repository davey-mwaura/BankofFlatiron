# Bank of Flariton

As a user, I should be able to:

- View a comprehensive table of all your transactions, providing you with a clear overview of your financial activity.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table as well as post the new transaction to the backend API for persistence.
- Easily filter through your transactions by using the search bar. Simply type in a keyword and only transactions that match the description will be displayed in the transactions table.
